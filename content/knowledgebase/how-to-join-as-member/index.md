### Using Xbox One, PS4/PS5 and Nintendo Switch

We do recommend using Proxy Servers or Apps, because these platforms do not natively support third party server.  
Recommendation:  
1. Public Instances of [Bedrock Connect](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect)
2. Public Instance of [geyserconnect.net](https://www.geyserconnect.net)
3. [MC Server Connector](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smokiem.mcserverconnector)
